        When enabled, the gateway uses HaLow for backhaul by default.
        When disabled, the gateway uses 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi only by default.
        This can be changed at runtime via the Settings web UI (http://192.168.4.1/settings).

        (HaLow, WiFi STA, 2.4 GHz AP) are built. Dashboard, ESP-NOW,
        iperf3, sensor gateway, time sync, and weather are excluded
        (not just hidden) to reduce RAM and CPU usage.
